Going out with a bang
===============

This is an application written using C++ and the Qt framework. 

It mainly uses CRUD operations, as well as multiple undo/ redo for the operations done.
  
Important features I used while developing the application:
  * used STL
  * the operations where done using different types of files(read from/ write to files): text, CSV or HTML files
  * UML diagram
  * 99% test coverage
  * chart for the data using Qt 
  * used TableView and ListView
  * used the Observer pattern
  * displayed an image in a TableView using QtPainter( a custom delegate)
  * the undo/ redo will be done by pushing a button or by using key combinations( Ctrl + Z for undo and Ctrl + Y for redo)
