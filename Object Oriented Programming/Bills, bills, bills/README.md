Bills, bills, bills
===================

This is an application for the management of a person's list of bills. It is written using C++ and the Qt framework. 

The application has the following functionalities:
  * visualizes all the data using a QListWidget
  * sorts the data by pressing a button
  * calculates the sum of the unpaid bills
  
I used files to read the data from.
The widgets are automatically resized and repositioned.
