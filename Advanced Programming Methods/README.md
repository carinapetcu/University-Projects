Toy Language Interpretor
========================

This is a project written using Java and it is ongoing. It implements an interpretor for a toy language. 
I implemented it using a Model-View-Controller design pattern, as well as a layered architecture. 

So far, I did the following:
  * implemented the statements required for the toy language( the variable declaration, while statement, as well as operation with files and memory allocation statement)
  * implemented expressions for the toy language( arithmetic, logical etc)
  * implemented ADTs for the toy language( dictionary, stack, heap and list)
  * implemented and used concurrency in Java
  * used Java streams
