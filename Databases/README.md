Foreign Music Platform
======================

Here is the database of a foreign music platform( by foreign I mean songs released in any other language except Romanian).
Currently, there are 3 projects done in SQL Server and T-SQL:
  1. Created the database and the tables required for it
  2. Added data and did several queries with the data in the tables
  3. Used stored procedures and brought the database to different versions
  4. Tested the database( I deleted all the data from different tables used in tests and added new one using generically done procedures)
  5. Used indexes( clustered/ nonclustered)
