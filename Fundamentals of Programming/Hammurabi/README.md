Hammurabi
=============

The application is a simulation. The user is the mighty Hammurabi and they must be for a period of 5 years the ruler of Sumeria. Each year they have to decide the capital 
city's land management policy, make sure that the people do not starve and plant next year's root. The game lasts for 5 turns, each turn being a year.
The game ends after the 5 years are up. If the population is over 100 and they have over 1000 acres, they win, otherwise it is a lose.

The project has a layered architecture structure.
